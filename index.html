                                and keep up to date. There are many children in institutions - babysitters are
                                unable to remember all information about each of them and successfully pass them on to
                                parents.

                <!-- <h3>Why this project was created?</h3>
                <p class="text">The functioning of a child in kindergarten is an important matter for both the child and
                    the parent,
                    it is obvious. Information and good communication are at this point essential for good cooperation
                    between both parties and, consequently, for the well-being of the child. However, the situation in
                    kindergarten can be dynamic, there are not always appropriate circumstances for transmitting
                    information, which, given the number of children, is large and it is not easy to organize and
                    remember. Nowadays, when we use applications to make purchases, order food and communicate for
                    business and private purposes, it seems obvious that there should be a tool that will collect and
                    organize information for people, and enable their efficient transfer. Thanks to this, parents and
                    guardians can save time, be more up to date with the preschooler's life, establish closer
                    relationships with others, improve the comfort of their child thanks to better cooperation with the
                    staff and greater commitment. Children usually spend as much time in kindergarten as their parents
                    do at work, i.e. most of the day, in an important period of very intensive development and learning,
                    in which the main contribution is made by the institution they attend. It is definitely worth
                    supporting them on this path.</p> -->
